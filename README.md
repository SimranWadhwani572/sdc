# Udemy-Self-Driving-Cars
Code of Udemy The Complete Self-Driving Car Course

* Use OpenCV to identify lane lines for a self-driving car.

* Train a Perceptron-based Neural Network to classify between binary classes.

* Train Convolutional Neural Networks to identify between various traffic signs.

* Train Deep Neural Networks to fit complex datasets.

* Build and train a fully functional self driving car to drive on its own.

* My assignments for Kalman Filters course.
